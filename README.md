## Overview
TuneNet uses AI to classify every inputed song into 10 different categories, these being: blues, classical, countr, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock. In thise implementation both Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks are used, showing a big difference between both models. Also, regularization and data augmentation techniques are used in order to achieve better performance of the model. This project can be tested since it is uploaded to Hugging Face Spaces in order to give it a try ([huggingface.co/spaces/diegovelilla/TuneNet](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diegovelilla/TuneNet)).

## Features
- Online music genre classification.
- Valuable insights from the model selection process.

## Usage:
Go to the URL [https://huggingface.co/spaces/diegovelilla/TuneNet](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diegovelilla/TuneNet) and upload a .wav file (ideally a song and from one of the 10 trained genres :) ).
Then wait for the prediction and repeat.
